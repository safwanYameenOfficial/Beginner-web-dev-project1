### My first project deployed and uploaded to Github.
Building this project, I learned a few things other than the very basics of HTML and CSS. Those include: 
- manipulating the DOM through Javascript
- making the design easy on the eye by implementing the right positions and font sizes. I got to know more about em and rem units in CSS.
- Learned the basics of responsive design and tried my best to make it work on different screen sizes.
- Deploying on the web using Netlify

Looking forward to upload more project as I learn more. ðŸ¤©
